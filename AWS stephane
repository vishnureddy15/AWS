Hibernate:===
When you restart the instance, it resumes from where it left off, including all applications and processes that were running. 
This feature essentially allows you to "pause" your instance rather than shutting it down completely.
Development and Testing: Developers can pause their EC2 instances when they are not actively working, then resume later with their environment (including data and configurations) fully intact.
Batch Processing: For workloads that are resource-intensive and can be interrupted (such as large data processing tasks), hibernating the instance can reduce cost and still allow for easy resumption.

TCP and HTTP/HTTPS
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a transport-layer protocol. It’s responsible for reliably transporting data between two devices, establishing a connection, and ensuring that the data is delivered in the correct order. 
It doesn’t concern itself with what kind of data is being transmitted (i.e., the actual content of the packets).
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (HTTP Secure) are application-layer protocols that use TCP as their transport protocol. 
HTTP/HTTPS defines how data is formatted and transmitted over the web (such as web pages, APIs, etc.). When a web browser requests a web page, it uses HTTP or HTTPS, but under the hood, it relies on TCP to ensure reliable communication between the client (your browser) and the server.
Trade-Offs: UDP vs. TCP    =========
While UDP is faster and more efficient in certain use cases, it comes with trade-offs:

Reliability: TCP guarantees that data arrives in order, without loss, and without duplication, making it the best choice for applications where reliability is critical (e.g., file transfers, web browsing, email).
Flow Control: TCP automatically adjusts the flow of data to avoid overwhelming the receiver or network, which is important for applications that need to manage large volumes of data without causing congestion.
Data Integrity: With TCP, if a packet is lost or corrupted, it is retransmitted. In contrast, UDP does not provide this error recovery mechanism, and applications must handle errors themselves if needed.

AWS TRANSFER FAMILY::
AWS Transfer for FTP allows you to expose specific files or directories stored in your S3 bucket over FTP without exposing the entire S3 bucket to the public.
By using IAM policies and AWS Transfer Family configuration, you can control which files or directories are made available to the FTP users, offering granular access while keeping the rest of the S3 data secure.
=======================================================================================================

AWS Cognito::
Cognito is specifically designed for user authentication and authorization in your web and mobile applications.
Cognito integrates easily with other AWS services like Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda, S3, and DynamoDB, allowing you to secure access to resources and services without compromising on flexibility or security.
==================================================================================================================
Amazon Athena::
Amazon Athena enables you to run SQL queries on data stored in Amazon S3 without having to move or transform the data.
=======================================================================================================
AWS Egress::
out bount traffic from AWS to outside it is cost
AWS Ingress::
inboud traffic from out side yto AWS ( it is fress of cost)
=====================================================================================================
Recovery point objective::
how much of data loss in may be 1 hr os more or else high

Recovery time objective::
how much the time to recover the loss data is down time.
=============================================================================================================
Database Migration Service::
It's a fully managed service that helps you migrate databases to AWS quickly and securely. With DMS, you can migrate your databases to AWS without downtime. 
===================================================================================================================
AWS Backup::
it is indeed a service provided by AWS. It is a fully managed backup service that enables you to centralize and automate the backup of data across various AWS services as well as on-premises environments.
and we have AWS vault lock even root use r also not able to delete back up data.
AWS Backup enables you to centralize and automate data protection across AWS services. It helps you support your regulatory compliance or business policies for data protection.
