Hibernate:===
When you restart the instance, it resumes from where it left off, including all applications and processes that were running. 
This feature essentially allows you to "pause" your instance rather than shutting it down completely.
Development and Testing: Developers can pause their EC2 instances when they are not actively working, then resume later with their environment (including data and configurations) fully intact.
Batch Processing: For workloads that are resource-intensive and can be interrupted (such as large data processing tasks), hibernating the instance can reduce cost and still allow for easy resumption.
